A customized typora theme.

#### To use or edit:

- Extract the downloaded zip to the root directory of the theme folder
- You should have a folder called mrgoose and a css file called mrgoose.cdd
- Reopen Typora -> Themes and see if mrgoose appears in the menu
  - If yes, click on it and you will be using this theme
  - If not, quit Typora and reopen, try this a few times and eventually it should work (xd)
